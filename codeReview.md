# Code Review of Potluck2X
## by Neil Routley

I really like the idea of being able to coordinate potlucks through your site and have it keep track of dividing items between attendees.  Everything looks good and seems to be very reactive... Good job on keeping everything organized and components separated.

While looking through the code I found a few eslint errors but it looks like they were fixed on Michelle's repo.

Nice work!
